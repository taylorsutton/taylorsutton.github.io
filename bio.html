   <p>My name is Taylor Sutton. I am a student of Visual Communication Design at Eastern Washington University. I originally studied Electrical Engineering and photovoltaics at Washington State University before changing my career choice in 2012. Since then I have started a Youtube Channel, programmed a few small games with my friends and have revived my love of illustration and comics. I hope to graduate fall of 2016.</p>
